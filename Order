Full BT - Each node has either 0 or 2 child nodes
Complete BT - All the nodes are completely filled except the last level and last level nodes should be as left as possible
Perfect BT - All leaf nodes should be at the same level
Balanced BT - Difference between the left and the right subtree for any node is not more than one
Degenerate BT - Skew binary tree - all the nodes will be present either on left side or on right side
